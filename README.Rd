We propose a novel computational framework, m6A-Disease Prediction using Graph Convolutional Networks and Positive Unlabeled Learning with self-Adaptive Sampling (m6ADP-GCNPUAS), to accurately predict m6A-disease associations. m6ADP-GCNPUAS effectively captures the embedded features of 
m6A sites or diseases using GCN model. Given the very limited m6A-disease associations, m6ADP-GCNPUAS adopts the PUAS framework to augment the potential positive samples, which improves the predictive power for m6A-disease associations.
